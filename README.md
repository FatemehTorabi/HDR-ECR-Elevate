# Welcome to HDR UK Elevate


Through this series of events our main goal is to address what fuels successful health data research collaborations. 

ECR community often face long waits until finding the opportunity to shadow these processes and even then it is often focused on an institutional or team approach. Now aiming to bring experiences together and grow as a community, in these series of events we will bring together a well curated experience talks covering aspects of research which are often untouched. 


**This is ECR safe room so feel free to through ideas, brain storm, share stories and talk research!**

# The journey so far

In September, HDR UK hosted the inaugural ECR Forum which welcomed a group of multidisciplinary and emerging researchers and technologists – working or studying in health data science – into one space. The forum gave us an opportunity to meet, collaborate and discuss challenges and opportunities unique to early-stage researchers. It also allowed us to learn from one another and a diverse range of speakers and workshop leaders.
